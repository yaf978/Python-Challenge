# Python-Challenge

1- PyBank:

We have a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv]. 

The dataset comprises two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses" for a seven-year.

the script analyzing the financial records to calculate :

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

then save the results of calculating in a text file and print it on screen

2- PyPoll:

We are helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

The given dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

The script  analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


* The total number of votes cast


* A complete list of candidates who received votes


* The percentage of votes each candidate won


* The total number of votes each candidate won


* The winner of the election based on popular vote.


Then print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
